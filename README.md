# Redesigning a Previous Project

This project is a redesign of a previous project, focusing on improving the UI and UX using advanced CSS concepts and ideas that we've learned in class. The project that I have chosen to work on is one of my first css styled webpages (My Portfolio) that I completed in Fall 2022. The goal was to transform the original project by implementing custom styles, typography, backgrounds, and layout enhancements.

## Introduction

Before updating the design, let's have a look at how the webpage looked like in 2022:
